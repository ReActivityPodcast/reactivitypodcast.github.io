We now have a blog for our podcast. You can go check it out at [reactivityshow.com](http://reactivityshow.com). I have been thinking to set up a blog for some time now and the last week I was able to set it up from scratch.

Intro

Hello, and welcome to the show I am your host Kalyan and this is a show where we talk about all things android from the latest new steps and experiences to help you become a better developer.

In this episode of the reactivity podcast, I want to share my thoughts on building a blog and how I set up one for our podcast.

Blogs have come a long way from blogpost websites two decades ago to medium publications these days, and there have been countless blogs out there today. Even with these many blogs remember that content is the pillar and quality content always stands out from the rest.

When I decided to set up a blog for our podcast I had to validate the available options today and choose one.

So my goal was to set up a quick and easy blog so that I donâ€™t waste so much time on writing one from scratch and at the same time I want a robust platform that I can build upon slowly.

So with this target, the first thing that came to my mind is good old WordPress. WordPress used to be my favorite platform and the primary suggestion for someone who wants to start blogging. To me, WordPress is an example that resonates with the fact that you don't need a shiny new framework or programming language to build a robust platform that can handle millions of users efficiently.

Of course, nowadays there are others like Square space and Wix, that can help set up a blog or website with lots of functionality very easily. But obviously, luxury comes with a cost.

Even though the cost wasn't a big deal for the speed that we get back in return, the developer in me wouldn't be happy if I choose WordPress. I wanted to dive in a bit and take this as an opportunity to learn as well.

Thinking about the other extreme end, where I write a web app from scratch using the latest and greatest frameworks isn't my goal anyway. My first requirement is to be quick. So even though it is exciting to start a project from scratch, I resisted not starting a new project again.

In regards to time, choosing a middle ground makes sense. But what about the cost? I should also think about choosing a non-expensive option. I should find a platform to host the blog in the first place. There are tens of providers out there for this and due to that, the prices of website or blog hosting have come down a lot these days compared to 5 years ago.

But in order to start with a minimum expense, my attention went towards Github pages. Github Pages helps the developer in me justifying that I have complete control of the blog and I get to write content right from my editor and most importantly in Markdown. This is also free to use. All I have to spend is on getting a domain. That's it.

I guess most of you are already familiar with Github Pages, but if you are not, you should check it out today. It is very helpful in setting up not just blogs, but also documentation sites, portfolio sites, and basically any static website or frontend.

So by now, I got my thoughts clear on moving ahead with Github pages and a static site generator for the blog.

With the popularity of Github pages, there have been many frameworks developed to ease the process of static site generation. These Static Site Generators basically apply your data and content to templates and generates the plain HTML pages which can be served to the browser directly.

Thus automating the whole process of building and deploying. Lately, I have seen tweets from many people saying about Gatsby and Netlify to streamline their blogging pipeline.
